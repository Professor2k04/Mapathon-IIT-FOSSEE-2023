MAP DESCRIPTION AND ANALYSIS

INTRODUCTION:
TO SHOW THE CROPS GROWN IN A STUDY AREA WITH ITS SOIL NUTRIENTS LIKE N,P,K,pH LEVEL

MAP DESCRIPTION:
THIS MAP SHOWS THE MAJOR CROPS GROWN IN THE THANJAVUR DISTRICT WITH THE N,P,K,pH LEVEL OF THE SOIL

N-NITROGEN
P-PHOSPORUS
K-POTASSIUM

THE ORDER OF THE VALUES IN EACH LABEL IS NITROGEN,PHOSPORUS,POTTASSIUM,pH LEVEL,CROP

CROPS GROWN IN THANJAVUR DISTRICT:
THE MAJOR CROPS GROWN IN THE THNAJAVUR DISTRICT ARE PADDY,PULSES,JAGGERY,GROUNDNUT & SUGARCANE.SMALL CROPS LIKE MAIZE,SOYABEAN,RED GRAM ARE GROWN HERE,

GROUNDNUTS ARE AN IMPORTANT CROP IN NEW DELTA AREA.LOAMY,CLAYEY,SANDY,ALLUVIAL ARE THE TYPES OF SOIL FOUND IN THE DISTRICT

THE MAJOR HORTICULTURE CROPS ARE FRUIT CROPS LIKE MANGO,BANANA,GUAVA,SAPOTA & VEGETABLES LIKE OKRA,TOMATO,EGGPLANT,ONION & FLOWERS LIKE JASMINE,CROSSANDRA


STEPS USED IN GIS TO CREATE STUDY AREA:
1.Download the Indian map shape files
2.Insert it into GIS software
3.Select the required study area and export it as another layer
4.Now insert a temporary scratch layer with points geometry and add the columns to be linked with those points
5.Now point the coordinates in the study area
6.Using the pointed coordinates show the labels required 
7.Now compose the map using New Print Layout with grids,scale,text etc…
8.Now export the map as .jpg file


USES OF THE STUDY AREA:
The study area created will be used to know about the amount of soil nutrients present in the soil by the farmers. 
The farmers will wisely use the NPK fertilizers and can grow crops naturally
This study area has a potential to become an app which will be highly useful for farmers
